name: FlawFinder security analysis

# This workflow is currently disabled, except manual trigger (workflow_dispatch),
# because it generates too many false positives. FlawFinder is very awkward.
# For instance, every call to a method named open() results in an error ("Check
# when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks), etc...")
# Even though this open() method has nothing to do with files. And there are
# many examples like this.
